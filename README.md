# VGGCIFAR
Classification of Cifar-10 dataset using VGG-like Convolutional Neural Network

# Model
Define VGG-like CNN model based on [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556/).  
  
A little changes are made compared to the original model.

In my attempt, "BN before Relu" makes less overfitting than "BN after Relu".  
Having not tried it, **learning rate decay** may be valid to this optimization.
